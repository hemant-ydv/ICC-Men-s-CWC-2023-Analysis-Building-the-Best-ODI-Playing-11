Mahmudullah,Bangladesh,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"An allrounder who bowls tidy offspin and bats in the middle order, Mahmudullah has spent the last three years figuring out how fickle form can be. In late 2012, he was the star who derailed West Indies to their first ODI series defeat in Bangladesh, and was a step away from captaincy. A poor season later, his place was continually questioned and he was even dropped for the 2014 Asia Cup. After another five months, Mahmudullah finally found form and became an automatic choice."
Jasprit Bumrah,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him. "
Kuldeep Yadav,India,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations."
Mark Wood,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"It looked, for a while, as if Mark Wood would be another of those fast bowlers who promised more than they delivered."
Dimuth Karunaratne,Sri Lanka,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Opening Batter,"Dimuth Karunaratne is a solid left-hand opening batsman, and another alumnus of the St Joseph's College side that produced Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera, whom he also played with in the Sri Lanka Under-19 side. Karunaratne made his first class debut for Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) in 2008, but had a quiet first season, batting largely in the middle order. "
Mohammed Shami,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Shami was India's leading fast bowler in the 2015 World Cup in Australia, when the team marched into the semi-finals and picked up 77 out of 80 wickets on offer. It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. "
Dushan Hemantha,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder,
Liam Livingstone,England,,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak",Batting Allrounder,"The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine."

He has now emerged as one of several contenders for the all-rounders' spots in Bangladesh's white-ball teams, having already played in three separate T20I series from 2018 to 2020. "

Naveen-ul-Haq,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,
Imam-ul-Haq,Pakistan,,Left hand Bat,,Top order Batter,"Prodigious or privileged? Imam ul Haq answered that question emphatically right at the get-go, stopping conspiracy theorists and cynics who cried nepotism - his uncle is chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq - with a glorious start to his international career. A hundred against Sri Lanka on debut made him the second player from Pakistan to reach three figures in his first match. He followed that up with a splendid outing in Zimbabwe, where he scored three centuries and became the first player in ODI history to score four hundreds in his first nine matches."
Mohammad Nawaz,Pakistan,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nawaz started out in cricket at the age of 14 as a left-arm medium-fast bowler and a middle-order batsman. An all-round performance of 60 runs and a four-for for Rawalpindi against Sialkot in an inter-region Under-16 tournament in 2008 earned him a place in the Pakistan side for the International Under-15 Championship in the West Indies. On the slow pitches of the Caribbean, he changed his bowling style to left-arm spin and transformed into a spin-bowling allrounder, with help from  coach Ameer Akbar and team manager Haroon Rashid. "
Mohammed Siraj,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. "
Josh Hazlewood,Australia,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A tall and accurate fast bowler who is unrelenting in his line and length, Josh Hazlewood became a fixture in Australia's Test attack as soon as he made his debut in December 2014. Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame."
Josh Inglis â€ ,Australia,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis, who was born in Leeds before relocating to Australia as a 14-year-old, moved quickly into the national reckoning over the last two years after finding his feet for both Western Australia and Perth Scorchers. A versatile and hard-hitting batter, he enjoyed a breakthrough Sheffield Shield season in 2020-21 with 585 runs including his first three first-class hundreds having previously churned out runs at grade level without quite making the step up. That followed consecutive 400-plus run seasons for Scorchers in the BBL - where his adaptability at moving from the top order to the middle was noted by selectors - and having continued to flay runs in county cricket for Leicestershire he was named in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup despite not being part of any of the previous series.

Shoriful Islam,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"At 6ft three inches, Shoriful Islam became a left-arm pace sensation almost overnight, when he starred in Bangladesh's 2020 Under-19 World Cup triumph. He took nine wickets, but it was his aggression and pace in the knockout games against South Africa, New Zealand and (in the final against) India that stood out."
Glenn Maxwell,Australia,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats. His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example -appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. "
Najibullah Zadran,Afghanistan,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Najibullah Zadran packs a punch with his bellicose left-hand batting, despite his slight frame. He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"
James Neesham,New Zealand,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Allrounder, and Twitter star, Jimmy Neesham went from the brink of retirement from cricket to almost delivering New Zealand the 2019 World Cup. In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. "
Dushmantha Chameera,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall, slim and slippery, Dushmantha Chameera arrived at NCC in 2012, and was quickly marked out as a bowler for the future. First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18."
Mustafizur Rahman,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. "

Dasun Shanaka (c),Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"An explosive middle-order batsman, and steady right-arm seam bowler, Dasun Shanaka worked his way into Sri Lanka's T20 side through several seasons of good performances for Sinhalese Sports Club. Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier."
Lockie Ferguson,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A right-arm quick with a good bouncer, it is Lockie Ferguson's speed that made a breakout star at the 2019 World Cup in England. Regularly hitting 150kph, Ferguson's raw speed bowling first change yielded 21 wickets at just 19.47 and an economy rate of 4.88. He finished second on the tournament wicket tally behind Mitchell Starc. He was rewarded with being named in the ICC's team of the tournament alongside skipper Kane Williamson. "
Matt Henry,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A slippery fast bowler, Matt Henry almost didn't play for New Zealand, as he underwent a major back surgery in 2012. Two years later, though, he was called up as cover during the ODI series against India, and thanks to a niggle to fellow injury-prone Hamish Bennett, Henry put the black cap on and registered the third-best figures for a New Zealand debutant in ODIs, claiming four wickets to seal New Zealand's 4-0 series triumph."
Kane Williamson (c),New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010."
Glenn Phillips,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Glenn Phillips is a compact, muscular hitter, known for playing outrageous shots, like the reverse pull. Born in South Africa, Phillips moved to New Zealand with his family at the age of five and has come through the cricket set-up in Auckland. He is a multi-dimensional player, who bats, bowls fastish offspin, fields superbly inside the ring and in the outfield, and keeps part-time as well."
Gus Atkinson,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,It may seem odd to talk of 2022 as a breakthrough year for Gus Atkinson given he only turned out for Surrey in four County Championship and six Vitality Blast matches. But there was evidently enough encouragement around his potential for the Desert Vipers to recruit him for the inaugural ILT20 at the start of 2023. 
Mitchell Santner,New Zealand,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"A left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner was first elevated to the New Zealand side after a promising 2014-15 domestic season. "

Kusal Mendis (c)â€ ,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "
Andile Phehlukwayo,South Africa,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder,"Seam-bowling allrounder Andile Phehlukwayo made himself a part of South Africa's white-ball sides with his skill at the death, the ability to disguise his slower ball, and ability to contribute with the bat as a finisher. "
Pat Cummins (c),Australia,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances."
Rashid Khan,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowling Allrounder,"Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. "
Hasan Ali,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Hasan Ali is a medium-fast bowler with a simple bowling action and a blend of variations. He made his first-class debut at the age of 19 and impressive against Lahore Ravi with a four-wicket haul in the first innings. His career started with club cricket and rose up to the regional Under-16 level but he did not make youth squads at national level. However, he managed to gain some attention in the 2015 National T20 Cup in where he picked up eight wickets in four matches under the captaincy of Shoaib Malik. His 17 wickets at 17.05 in the National One-Day cup in 2016 was a key part of him being promoted to the Pakistan side. Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League."

Sam Curran,England,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. "
Jos Buttler (c)â€ ,England,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018."
Jonny Bairstow,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Jonny Bairstow, the son of the former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow, is a combative wicketkeeper-batter who has become a cricketer to be reckoned with in England's middle order. The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed."
Rohit Sharma (c),India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20."
Colin Ackermann,Netherlands,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Having relinquished his South African qualification to sign a contract with Leicestershire, taking advantage of an EU passport, Colin Ackermann was part of the late-2010s exodus that rocked cricket in his home country. Although less heralded at the time, Ackermann was a former South Africa U-19 who had topped the Sunfoil averages in 2016-17, and might have been in contention for a Test call-up had he not taken the well-trodden English county route."

Aiden Markram (c),South Africa,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"The first South Africa captain to win a World Cup, albeit at age-group level, Aiden Markram announced himself as champion material early. He led South Africa's Under-19s to World Cup glory in 2014 and was also their leading run-scorer and third overall. It took him another three years to break into the senior side, but when he did, he made an impact right away with 97, 143 and 125 in his first three Tests, at home against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. "
Max O'Dowd,Netherlands,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,
Najmul Hossain Shanto,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Nazmul Hossain Shanto emerged from an unusual source in Bangladesh cricket - the schools. A double-century in a school one-day match in Rajshahi grabbed the attention of age-group scouts, who quickly drafted the left-hander into Bangladesh's Under-17s. Soon, he graduated to the Under-19s in 2013, and went on to play two World Cups at that level, in 2014 and 2016."
Tanzid Hasan,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,,Opening Batter,
Mitchell Marsh,Australia,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Mitchell Marsh, one of the most well-known surnames in Australian cricket, can bowl 140kph, and is a hard-hitting middle-order bat. He has been an alluring prospect for Australia but has struggled to cement his place at international level despite some outstanding performances on the big stage."
Taskin Ahmed,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Even before he was anywhere near making his international debut, Taskin Ahmed became an internet sensation. A video of his spell against England Under-19s in 2012 found its way to Youtube, and the sight of a Bangladeshi fast bowler ripping it past batsman and hitting the wicketkeeper's gloves quite hard and high made people curious."
Mitchell Starc,Australia,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."
Azmatullah Omarzai,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,
Will Young,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,
Tim Southee,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes."
Kusal Mendis â€ ,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "
Ishan Kishan,India,,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A wicketkeeper and left-handed opening batsman from Jharkhand, the same state MS Dhoni hails from, Ishan Kishan led India at the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 in Bangladesh, where his team finished runners-up to West Indies."
Trent Boult,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions."
Harry Brook,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"In the winter of 2022-23, Harry Brook announced himself as one of the world's most exciting young players with a staggering run of form across formats, most particularly in England's rebooted Test team. After making his debut against South Africa in September 2022, Brook travelled to Pakistan and New Zealand with Ben Stokes' team, where he peeled off consecutive scores of 153, 87, 9, 111, 89, 54, and 186 to take his overall tally to 809 runs in nine innings, at an extraordinary strike-rate of 98.77. No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brook's anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in England's thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement. "
Moeen Ali,England,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann."
Tom Latham â€ ,New Zealand,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"The son of former allrounder Rod Latham, Tom Latham played varied roles for New Zealand since his international debut at the age of 19. He batted in every position from No. 1 to 9 in limited-overs cricket, and also took on the responsibility of being a wicketkeeper. In Tests, however, Latham was primarily used as an opening batsman, and he quickly settled into a position New Zealand had trouble filling for years."
Shadab Khan,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder,"A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career."
Virat Kohli,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them."
Paul van Meekeren,Netherlands,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Paul van Meekeren drew attention to himself during the World Twenty20 qualifiers in 2016 when he produced a spell of 4 for 11 against Ireland. A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.

Marnus Labuschagne,Australia,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Batter,"Marnus Labuschagne's ascent to the higher echelons of Test batting was an extraordinary tale of making the most of an unexpected opportunity. During the Lord's Ashes Test against England in August 2019, Steven Smith was felled by Jofra Archer's bouncer and Labuschagne would become his concussion substitute - the first time in Test history the protocol had been used. By the end of the year he had eclipsed Smith as the leading Test run-scorer in the world, and locked in the No. 3 spot, in the midst of a prolific home summer that brought him four centuries in five matches against Pakistan and New Zealand including a double century at the SCG."

In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a (mullet-wearing) colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical."

Four years later, he was part of the Under-19 team that beat Australia and Sri Lanka, and was rewarded with a spot in the squad for Afghanistan's first full tour of Zimbabwe. His favourite shot is the cover-drive and he idolises Kumar Sangakkara.Liam Brickhill"
Cameron Green,Australia,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Batting Allrounder,"Cameron Green was earmarked as an international cricket from very early. Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA's junior teams his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability.

A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt."

And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted England to another level. Never was that more true than when he secured his place in English cricket history with an indefatigable batting display in the 2019 World Cup final. In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins."

His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy. He also bowls part-time left-arm spin which he has been encouraged to continue to work on. As a teenager he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing rugby in New Zealand but it did not stall his cricket career.

Mohammad Rizwan â€ ,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.
